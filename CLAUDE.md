# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a presentation repository containing materials about AI tools for software development. The repository structure is documentation-focused rather than code-focused.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main documentation with AI tools overview and resources
- `notes.md` - Simple notes file with VS Code Copilot reference
- `slides/` - Presentation materials
  - `slides.md` - Marp-formatted presentation slides
  - `slides.pdf` - Compiled PDF version of slides

## Working with Presentations

The slides use Marp (https://marp.app/) for markdown-to-slide conversion with the Gaia theme. The slides.md file contains:

- Marp configuration in YAML frontmatter
- Gaia theme with custom styling
- Slide separators using `---`
- CSS customizations for the lead class

## MCP Configuration

This repository includes an MCP configuration file (`.mcp.json`) with the following servers:

- **Context7** - Connected via SSE transport at `https://mcp.context7.com/sse`

## Content Focus Areas

Based on the README, this repository covers:

- AI development tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Community resources
- Best practices for AI in software development

The content references Anthropic documentation particularly around Claude Code modes and workflows.
