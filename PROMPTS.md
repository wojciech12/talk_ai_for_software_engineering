# Prompt Engineering Best Practices
*From the perspective of a Principal Anthropic Software Engineer*

## Core Principles (Confidence: 95%)

### 1. Specificity Over Ambiguity
**High-impact keywords**: `exactly`, `specifically`, `precisely`, `must`, `never`, `always`
```
❌ "Make it better"
✅ "Optimize this function to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)"
```

### 2. Context Before Task (Confidence: 90%)
Structure prompts with context first, then the specific request:
```
Given this React component with performance issues [context]
Optimize it for rendering large lists [task]
Use virtualization techniques [constraint]
```

### 3. Output Format Specification (Confidence: 88%)
Always specify desired output format explicitly:
- `Return as JSON with keys: x, y, z`
- `Respond in bullet points`
- `Format as executable bash commands`
- `Structure as: Problem, Solution, Test Plan`

## High-Impact Prompt Structures (Confidence: 92%)

### The CLEAR Framework
- **C**ontext: Background information
- **L**imitations: Constraints and boundaries  
- **E**xamples: Sample inputs/outputs
- **A**ction: Specific task to perform
- **R**esult: Expected deliverable format

### The Role-Task-Format Pattern (Confidence: 85%)
```
You are a [ROLE] with expertise in [DOMAIN].
Your task is to [SPECIFIC_ACTION].
Format your response as [STRUCTURE].
```

## Power Keywords by Category (Confidence: 87%)

### Precision Modifiers
- `exactly` - Forces literal interpretation
- `specifically` - Narrows scope
- `only` - Limits scope boundaries
- `must`/`never` - Hard constraints

### Quality Enhancers  
- `comprehensive` - Signals thoroughness needed
- `detailed` - Requests depth
- `step-by-step` - Structured approach
- `systematic` - Methodical execution

### Behavior Controllers
- `first`, `then`, `finally` - Sequence control
- `before proceeding` - Gate conditions
- `validate that` - Quality checks
- `ensure` - Verification requirements

## Advanced Techniques (Confidence: 83%)

### Chain of Thought Activation
```
Think through this step by step:
1. Analyze the problem
2. Consider alternatives  
3. Choose the best solution
4. Implement it
```

### Few-Shot Examples (Confidence: 91%)
Provide 2-3 examples of input-output pairs before the actual task.

### Constraint Stacking (Confidence: 78%)
Layer multiple constraints for precise control:
```
Write Python code that:
- Uses only standard library
- Handles edge cases explicitly  
- Includes comprehensive docstrings
- Follows PEP 8 style
- Has O(n) time complexity
```

## Common Anti-Patterns (Confidence: 94%)

### ❌ Vague Qualifiers
- "good", "better", "nice", "clean"
- Instead: specific metrics or criteria

### ❌ Implicit Assumptions
- Assuming knowledge of context
- Instead: explicit context provision

### ❌ Multiple Unrelated Tasks
- Bundling disparate requests
- Instead: one clear primary objective

### ❌ Emotional Language
- "please", "try to", "maybe"
- Instead: direct, confident instructions

## Domain-Specific Patterns (Confidence: 89%)

### Code Generation
```
Implement [FUNCTION_NAME] that:
- Takes parameters: [LIST]
- Returns: [TYPE] 
- Handles these edge cases: [CASES]
- Uses [ALGORITHM/PATTERN]
- Time complexity: [BIG_O]
```

### Code Review
```
Review this [LANGUAGE] code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks  
- Style violations
- Logic errors
- Provide fix suggestions with line numbers
```

### Debugging
```
This [LANGUAGE] code produces [ERROR].
Debug by:
1. Identifying the root cause
2. Explaining why it occurs
3. Providing the corrected code
4. Listing prevention strategies
```

## Testing and Validation (Confidence: 86%)

### Prompt Testing Framework
1. **Minimal viable prompt** - Start simple
2. **Edge case variants** - Test boundaries
3. **Ambiguity injection** - Find weak points
4. **Constraint violation** - Test limits
5. **Format compliance** - Verify output structure

### Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness (measure against ground truth)
- **Completeness**: Addresses all requirements
- **Consistency**: Same input → same output
- **Efficiency**: Achieves goal with minimal tokens

## Claude-Specific Optimizations (Confidence: 96%)

### Leverage Constitutional Training
- Use ethical framing: "Consider the implications"
- Request reasoning: "Explain your approach"
- Ask for alternatives: "What are other options?"

### Token Efficiency
- Front-load critical information
- Use structured formats (JSON, YAML)
- Batch related requests
- Reference previous context explicitly

### Multi-turn Optimization
- Build context incrementally
- Use memory references: "As discussed earlier..."
- Maintain conversation state explicitly

## Measurement and Iteration (Confidence: 84%)

### Success Metrics
1. **Task completion rate** - % of fully satisfied requests
2. **Revision cycles** - Average iterations needed  
3. **Output quality** - Manual evaluation scores
4. **Context efficiency** - Useful output per token

### Continuous Improvement
- A/B test prompt variations
- Track failure patterns
- Build prompt templates for common tasks
- Maintain a prompt performance database

## Meta-Prompting Techniques (Confidence: 79%)

### Self-Validation Prompts
```
After generating the solution:
1. Check it against the requirements
2. Identify potential issues
3. Suggest improvements
4. Rate confidence (1-10)
```

### Prompt Chaining
Break complex tasks into sequential prompts where each builds on the previous output.

### Dynamic Prompting
Adjust prompt structure based on:
- Task complexity
- Domain expertise required
- Available context length
- Output format constraints
