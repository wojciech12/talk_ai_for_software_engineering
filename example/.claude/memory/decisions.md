# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## Decision Log Overview
This file tracks significant architectural and technical decisions made during development. Each decision includes context, considered alternatives, and rationale.

## ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Initial project setup

### Context
Need to choose technology stack for hello world demonstration that shows best practices while being accessible and maintainable.

### Decision
- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Build Tools**: Create React App (Webpack under the hood)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Vue.js + Nuxt**: Good developer experience but React has broader adoption
2. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Too basic for demonstrating modern patterns
3. **Next.js**: Adds unnecessary complexity for hello world demo
4. **TypeScript**: Adds value but increases complexity for demo purposes

### Rationale
- React is widely adopted and demonstrates modern patterns well
- Node.js provides JavaScript consistency across frontend/backend
- Jest + RTL is standard testing approach for React applications
- ESLint + Prettier ensures consistent code quality

### Consequences
- ✅ Familiar stack for most developers
- ✅ Rich ecosystem and community support
- ✅ Demonstrates modern JavaScript patterns
- ❌ May be overkill for simple hello world
- ❌ Bundle size considerations for frontend

## ADR-002: Component Architecture Pattern
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: CLAUDE.md requirements

### Context
Need to establish consistent component patterns that demonstrate best practices for scalable React applications.

### Decision
- **Only functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- **PropTypes** for runtime type checking
- **Custom hooks** for shared logic
- **Absolute imports** from `src/` directory
- **Component-per-file** organization

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Class components**: Legacy pattern, hooks are preferred
2. **TypeScript**: Better type safety but adds complexity
3. **Relative imports**: More fragile for refactoring
4. **Barrel exports**: Useful but adds indirection for demo

### Rationale
- Functional components align with React's current direction
- PropTypes provide type safety without TypeScript complexity
- Absolute imports improve code readability and refactoring
- Separation encourages proper component composition

### Consequences
- ✅ Modern React patterns demonstrated
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance
- ✅ Consistent code organization
- ❌ Slightly more verbose than class components
- ❌ PropTypes runtime overhead (minimal)

## ADR-003: API Design Conventions
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Backend architecture requirements

### Context
Need consistent API patterns that demonstrate production-ready practices while keeping implementation simple.

### Decision
- **RESTful conventions** for endpoint design
- **Consistent JSON response format**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": boolean,
    "data": any,        // on success
    "error": string     // on failure
  }
  ```
- **Express middleware** for common functionality
- **Async/await** throughout (no raw promises)
- **Comprehensive error handling** with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Alternatives Considered
1. **GraphQL**: Too complex for hello world demo
2. **Raw response formats**: Less consistent, harder to consume
3. **Promise chains**: Less readable than async/await
4. **Minimal error handling**: Poor practice demonstration

### Rationale
- REST is widely understood and implemented
- Consistent response format simplifies frontend consumption
- Async/await improves code readability
- Proper error handling demonstrates production practices

### Consequences
- ✅ Predictable API behavior
- ✅ Easy frontend integration
- ✅ Production-ready patterns
- ❌ Slightly more verbose than minimal approaches
- ❌ May be over-engineered for hello world scope

## ADR-004: Testing Strategy
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Quality assurance requirements

### Context
Need comprehensive testing approach that demonstrates best practices without excessive complexity for demo project.

### Decision
- **Jest** as primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Supertest** for API endpoint testing
- **80% code coverage** minimum requirement
- **Integration tests** for critical user flows
- **No mocking** for hello world simplicity

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Cypress**: Great for E2E but too heavy for demo
2. **Enzyme**: React Testing Library is now preferred
3. **Mocha/Chai**: Jest provides better React integration
4. **100% coverage**: Diminishing returns for demo project

### Rationale
- Jest + RTL is current React testing standard
- Integration tests provide confidence in real workflows
- 80% coverage balances quality with development speed
- Minimal mocking keeps tests simple and reliable

### Consequences
- ✅ Industry-standard testing practices
- ✅ Good confidence in code quality  
- ✅ Fast test execution
- ❌ Some test setup boilerplate
- ❌ May need refactoring if mocking becomes necessary

## ADR-005: Development Workflow and Tooling
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Developer experience requirements

### Context
Need development workflow that demonstrates professional practices while keeping setup simple for demo purposes.

### Decision
- **npm scripts** for all common tasks
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** via simple npm scripts (not husky for demo)
- **Concurrent development** servers for frontend/backend
- **Hot reloading** for development efficiency

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Yarn**: npm is more universally available
2. **Webpack config**: CRA handles this adequately
3. **Husky + lint-staged**: Adds complexity for demo
4. **Docker**: Overkill for hello world scope

### Rationale
- npm is included with Node.js installation
- ESLint + Prettier are industry standards
- Simple setup reduces barriers to running demo
- Hot reloading improves development experience

### Consequences
- ✅ Fast development iteration
- ✅ Consistent code quality
- ✅ Easy project setup
- ❌ Manual discipline required for quality checks
- ❌ Less automated than full pre-commit setup

## ADR-006: Claude Integration Patterns
**Date**: 2024-06-24  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Maker**: Demonstration project requirements

### Context
This project specifically demonstrates Claude Code best practices, so integration patterns need to showcase optimal human-AI collaboration.

### Decision
- **Comprehensive CLAUDE.md** with specific behavioral instructions
- **Structured memory management** in `.claude/memory/`
- **Custom commands** for common development tasks
- **Documentation-driven development** approach
- **Explicit context management** patterns

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Minimal Claude integration**: Wouldn't demonstrate best practices
2. **AI-first development**: Important to show human oversight
3. **Generic documentation**: Claude-specific patterns provide more value

### Rationale
- Demonstrates production-ready AI integration
- Shows how to maintain context across sessions
- Provides reusable patterns for real projects
- Balances AI assistance with human control

### Consequences
- ✅ Excellent demonstration of AI-assisted development
- ✅ Reusable patterns for other projects
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ❌ Additional complexity in project setup
- ❌ Requires understanding of Claude Code features

## Decision Review Process

### Monthly Review Checklist
- [ ] Are decisions still relevant to current project state?
- [ ] Have any consequences proven problematic?
- [ ] Do decisions align with evolving best practices?
- [ ] Should any decisions be revised or superseded?

### Decision Revision Protocol
1. Create new ADR with updated decision
2. Mark previous ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
3. Update CLAUDE.md and memory files accordingly
4. Communicate changes to development team

### Success Metrics
- **Decision stability**: Fewer than 20% of decisions require revision
- **Development velocity**: Decisions support rather than hinder progress  
- **Code quality**: Decisions result in maintainable, testable code
