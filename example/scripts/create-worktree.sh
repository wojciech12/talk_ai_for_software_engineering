## **WORKTREE ISOLATION CONTEXT**

### **This Session Focus (MANDATORY)**
- **Isolated Objective**: $focus
- **Branch**: $branch_name
- **Worktree**: $worktree_path
- **Created**: $(date)

### **CRITICAL ISOLATION RULES**
- **ONLY work on**: $focus
- **DO NOT**: Refactor unrelated code
- **DO NOT**: Change shared dependencies
- **DO NOT**: Modify build configuration
- **DO NOT**: Update documentation unrelated to this focus

### **Merge Strategy**
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Coordinate with main development branch
- Document all changes in commit messages

### **Context Management**
- This worktree has independent Claude context
- Memory files are isolated from main development
- Use this for focused, time-limited development
- Merge back to main when objective complete

# Isolated Project Context - $branch_name
*Created: $(date)*

## Current Session Focus
- **Primary Goal**: $focus
- **Branch**: $branch_name
- **Isolation Level**: High (independent from main development)
- **Time Limit**: 2 hours maximum to prevent context poisoning

## Key Constraints
- Work ONLY on: $focus
- No refactoring outside scope
- No dependency changes
- Merge back when complete

## Success Criteria
- [ ] $focus is implemented correctly
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No unrelated changes introduced
- [ ] Ready for merge to main

## Files in Scope
- [List specific files you'll modify]

## Files OUT OF SCOPE
- Build configuration
- Shared dependencies
- Unrelated features
- Documentation outside this feature

---
**Remember**: This is an isolated Claude session. Stay focused on single objective.
